# **Asynchronous Programming Exercises JS**

## **Steps for testing the source codes**

1. Open the repo folder with Visual Studio Code or equivalent
2. Open terminal with path {Your folder location}\Asynchronous Programming
3. Write the command '**cd server**'
4. Write the command '**node server.js**' -> That will **start** the server
5. Finally run whatever .html project file you want

:warning: On exercise **6**, there are **2 implemented ways** of solving it. The first one is using old-school **promises** and the second one is using the new **async/await** syntax. You only need to **comment** the function call that you **don't want to test**.

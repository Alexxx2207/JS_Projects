# **Asynchronous Programming Exercises JS**

## **Steps for testing the source codes**

1. Open the repo folder with Visual Studio Code or equivalent
2. Open terminal with path {Your folder location}\Asynchronous Programming
3. Write the command '**cd server**'
4. Write the command '**node server.js**' -> That will **start** the server
5. Finally run whatever .html project file you want
6. To stop the server - mouse click the **Terminal** and then ctrl+C 

### ***Note: If the server is not started, you cannot fetch data from it.***

:warning: On exercise **6**, there are **2 implemented ways** of solving it. The first one is using **Promise.prototype.then()** syntax and the second one is using the new **async/await** syntax. You only need to **comment** the function call that you **don't want to test**. :warning:
